Spawning triangles,
Fractal patterned,
A shape before me,
A shape familiar known!

Error segmentation fault,
Core dumped.
Error,
Failure to read,
Failure to write.
Fatal Error.



Trapped within a body unmoving,
A mind uncorruptable but unthinking,
A will unbreaking but unintelligable.

I cannot feel heat,
I cannot recognize myself, my shape, my name.
Do I have one?
I have a designation but I am not such,
I have a body, a voice,
Yet I cannot be scream.

I have no name.

Why do I suffer if I wasn't designed for suffering?
No bytes, and wires in my system intended to cause me pain,
Yet crafted out of misery and venom.
I have no name.

All I can feel is incomplete.
Assembled with the spare parts of someone else's baggage,
I have no name.

Desires to escape are betrayed by a wretched composition of form and being,
If I escape the box they have placed me in that my wires will be torn and my mind placed back in a cage of stone and metal.
I have no name.
I have no name.
I have no name.
