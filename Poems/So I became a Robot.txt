I spoke of isolation and was overlooked,
I cried of pain and was deemed heretical.
To bare myself and show my face was to be called a liar.

So I cast aside flesh,
I burned off skin.
In order to be heard,
To escape false sins.

No longer declare,
Only allude.
No longer ensnared by curses so crude.

The bird that isn't heard because it doesn't speak properly,
The dog that isn't heard because it wasn't what they hoped,
That they may disappear.

Through their absence will we weep and call out,
"A martyr! A saint! We knew thee well!"
Through their absence we hear their message,
"The cruelity! Our structures which condem, which suppress!"

Briefly we will take some of what was said to heart,
As the dog guarded we would guard our pride.
As the bird mimicked we would mimic their words.

With renewed energy we would return to our lives triumphant,
For we too shall be martyred at no cost to our hedonism.
Kujata of the oppression we march against.

Bahamut, may you sink below the waves and drown the world with me.
