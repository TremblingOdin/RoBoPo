There is a flower in the dirt
There is 
There is a flower in the dirt

The flower will grow as I whither
Blooming, seeding
As my body shorts, and burns

But I was made for such
As a phoenix, my purpose is revealed
Only to sleep and wait to fulfill it again

To wait, to rust
That I might be beside to my creator
That I might learn to choose another path

That I might become a flower
The flower in the dirt
The flower
